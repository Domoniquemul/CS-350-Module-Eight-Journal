Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project and what problem it was solving it was not understanding the code the project was about setting the timer for the switch board and adujsting the time for the colors to light up.

What did you do particularly well?
I don't feel like I did as good as I would have if I was able to understand the code better in looked at the accouncements. 

Where could you improve?
I believe I could improve on understanding the switch board and code copressor with the updated version. 

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
What really help me was tutoring with SNHU peers or one on one tutoring. To help me better understand the proccess. What I will add in usesd more is youtube since specfically I was able to understand different ways to solve the issues. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Working with a switch board will help me out in my fuill stack development class since its similar in puting in a code for a specfic action. An like full stack develpoment there is always alot of website deveplomemt that require specfic actions.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
How I made this project maintainable is by being consisted and readable by going over the final codes for errors as well as adaptable by being open to different reasons on how to work the code.
